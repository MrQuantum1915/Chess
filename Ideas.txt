    Left to do
    
IMP :conditional Compilation
    :  Use Pointers in calling differnt functions
    : memory allocation malloc
    : check bishop moves in all other
    : check for black pawn movement

        1. mark everytime when enpassant move (pawn directly moves to 2 jumps) so that while checking we can  
        2. build the check file to restrict the movement when the king is in check
        3. first king move? then possible castling.
